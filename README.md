# Task Manager
My task manager is a tool to help organise and manage things you need to do. Whether it's for personal, or work, all you need to do is type in what task you want, and you can put when they're due and how prioritise it.

You also have a page where you see your tasks on a calendar and another page to view how to use the website and a few tips. Switching between these parts is easy so you can do what you need to do.

If you need to find something specific, like a certain task or tasks related to a certain category, you can search for them. And if you want to see when things are due, you can check out the calendar view to plan ahead.
